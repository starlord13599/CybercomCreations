1.)localStorage ---> The read-only localStorage property allows you to access a Storage object for the 
    Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. localStorage is similar to 
    sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in 
    sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. (Data in a 
    localStorage object created in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the 
    last "private" tab is closed.

sessionStorage --->It is similar to localStorage, the only main differenc is that sessionStorage gets destroyed 
    or cleared after the tab/page is closed
