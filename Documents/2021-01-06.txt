1.) I practised the previous day commands again with different ways.

2.) i tried different permutations and combinations to cover up every situation possible with git and github.
    Also learned basic log and revert commands

3.) so basically i tried using this command "git push newbranch" the thing i was trying to do was to directly 
    push the commit to branch without mentioning the origin but turned out it is not applicable without mentioning
    the origin "git push origin newbranch"

4.)Also experimented "git push origin" on directly pushing to remote without mentioning the origin/branch but didnt work because 
"git push origin master" is a command that says "push the commits in the local branch named master to the 
remote named origin". Once this is executed, all the stuff that you last synchronised 
with origin will be sent to the remote repository and other people will be able to see them there.

5.)watched few videos to get indepth understanding of how git and github works, below are the links

6.) cleared and experimented what "pull request" means and how it works.

7.)learned about HEAD..how head works ,how it looks,learned about detached HEAD scenario works,basically master and 
    head are pointed at same position.HEAD generally points to branch but when it points to commit , a detached head 
    scenario takes place.It can be resolved by making head and master point at the same location.

8.) Also learned what 3-Way merge works.if the path between the branch(the one you want to merge) and the master branch
    is direct than FAST FORWARD MERGE takes place.And if the path is not direct RECURSIVE MERGING takes place.This is
    called 3-Way-Merge

9.) Also learned what conflicts are how to handle merge conflicts.
