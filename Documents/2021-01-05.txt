1.) Cleared all the terms regarding GIT and GITHUB like origin,remote,master,branch and many more.

2.) Also learned through different blogs what Secure Shell Hashing Key (SSH Key) means and why it is necessary 

3.) Was stuck at an error "'origin' is not a commit and a branch 'justdemo-branchhh' cannot be created from it"
    turned out, My remote name was already set to some previous old origin... So i changed that path using "git set url" and
    and cleared all my confusion regarding same.
    
4.) Also searched through different commands like git pull,git fork. What actually is the difference between them and how they act.
