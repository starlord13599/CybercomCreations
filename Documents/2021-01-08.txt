1.)Revised basic of JavaScript

2.)Cleared some doubt on the topic of Type Coercion

3.)Read the book "Eloquent Javascript:A Modern Introduction to Programming" by Marijn Haverbeke upto
the point of today's work.

4.)Used object in declaring variables in JS_challenge_1 as it becomes to easy to access property assigned
    particularly to that respective object.though it has one problem we can easily change the value
    Eg:- if John has two properties weight and height it better to create a object variable like this

    const mark = {
    height: 10,
    weight: 60
}

    difference too.
